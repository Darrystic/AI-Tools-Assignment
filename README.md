 NLP Dataset Integration and Model Analysis

This project demonstrates how to integrate and analyze multiple NLP datasets — the **Iris**, **MNIST**, and **Amazon Reviews** datasets — using Python, TensorFlow, and spaCy.  
It covers data importation through APIs, preprocessing, simple model training, named entity recognition (NER), and sentiment rule-based analysis.
